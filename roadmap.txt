Implement a "recommended" stream heuristic. Some ideas for data points include:
 - Higher score for subbed channels
     - Maybe slightly less for gifted?
 - Log directory clickthroughs and increase the favorability for the clicked stream relative to other live streams
 - Track user watch time, and increase the favorability for the watched stream relative to other live streams
 - Track each stream by category, and recommend based on the stream's current category if there's sufficient data
 - Track how often the user is in the stream while its offline
     - Need to avoid giving too much weight if the user is afk or just didn't close the tab or something
     - Consider chat participation?

Implement go-live notifications:
 - Notify for all streams that score above some threshold on the heuristic
 - Allow the user to manually enroll in notifications on a stream to stream basis, and always notify for that stream regardless of score
 - Score bonus when the user clickthroughs on the notification?
     - Small penalty if they don't?
