# smart-twitch-directory
Browser extension that replaces the twitch following directory with a smarter version that sorts by relevance.

The extension collects data about what streams the user watches, and uses that data to train a multilayer perception (MLP) to predict what the user will want to watch. These predictions are then used to sort the live stream directory, as well as serve the user notifications about streams they are likely to want to watch.
